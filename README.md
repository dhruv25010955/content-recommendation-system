# Hybrid Content Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a hybrid recommendation system that combines
content-based filtering (TF-IDF) and collaborative filtering (ALS)
to recommend items to users based on past interactions.

## Techniques Used
- TF-IDF for content similarity
- Alternating Least Squares (ALS) for collaborative filtering
- Hybrid weighted scoring

## Dataset
- Synthetic dataset generated programmatically
- No real user data used

## How to Run
1. Open `content_recommendation_system.ipynb`
2. Run all cells top-to-bottom

## Output
- Top-K item recommendations for a user
- Precision@K evaluation metric

## Ethical Considerations
- Synthetic data avoids privacy issues
- No automated real-world decision impact
